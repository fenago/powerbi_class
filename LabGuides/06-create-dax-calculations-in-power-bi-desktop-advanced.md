- Use Time Intelligence functions (Quick Measure)


<h4><span style="color:red;">Important! Make sure that you are working on the previous lab file for this exercise before starting the current one.</span></h4>


### **Lab story**

Our PowerBI labs are segregated into 9 labs, we suggest you do them in the following order:

1. Prepare Data in Power BI Desktop

2. Load Data in Power BI Desktop

3. Model Data in Power BI Desktop, Part 1

4. Model Data in Power BI Desktop, Part 2

5. Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 1

6. **Create DAX Calculations in Power BI Desktop, Part 2**

7. Create Reports in Power BI Desktop

8. Create a Power BI Dashboard
   
9. Perform Data Analysis


### **Task 1: Get started**

1. To open the Power BI Desktop, on the taskbar, click the Microsoft Power BI Desktop shortcut.

### **Task 2: Creating measures in PowerBI**

In this task you will create measures for the model.

**Creating Total Sales Measure:**

1. Navigate to Report View -> Select any table from the data pane -> Click on **New Measure**.

2. Enter the below formula 
`Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Sales])
`

**Creating Total Profit Measure:**

1. In report view -> Select any table from the data pane -> click on N**ew Measure**

2. Enter the below formula
`Total Profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])`

![2](https://github.com/Neha-Chiluka/power-bi-next-level/blob/master/Images/total%20profit.jpg?raw=true "2")

**Creating Total Orders Measure:**

1. In report view -> Select any table from the data pane -> click on **New Measure**

2. Enter the below formula
`Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)`

![3](https://github.com/Neha-Chiluka/power-bi-next-level/blob/master/Images/totaloders.jpg?raw=true "3")

**Creating TotalReturns Measure:**

1. In report view -> Select any table from the data pane -> click on **New Measure**

2. Enter the below formula
`Total Returns = COUNTROWS(FILTER(Returns, Returns[Returned] = "Yes"))`

**Creating AverageSales Measure:**

1. In report view -> Select any table from the data pane -> click on New Measure

2. Enter the below formula
`Average Sales = AVERAGE(Orders[Sales])`

### **Task 3: Use Time Intelligence Functions **

**Calculating YTD(Year-to-Date) using Quick Measure:**

**TotalYTD:-** Helps assess overall annual performance and trends. It allows businesses to evaluate how they are doing relative to annual goals or budgets.

1. In report view -> Select any table from the data pane -> click on **Quick Measure**

![3](https://github.com/Neha-Chiluka/power-bi-next-level/blob/master/Images/newmeasure.jpg?raw=true "3")

2. Click on the drop-dowm of calculation .

3. Scroll down to **Time Intelligence functions**

4. Select **Year-To-Date** option

![5](https://github.com/Neha-Chiluka/power-bi-next-level/blob/master/Images/yeartodate.jpg?raw=true "5")

5. Drag and drop **Sales** column in base value and **Order Date** in date column( from Orders table)

![6](https://github.com/Neha-Chiluka/power-bi-next-level/blob/master/Images/valuesytd.jpg?raw=true "6")

6. Click on **Add** option

**Calculating QTD(Quarter-to-Date) using Quick Measure:**

**TotalQTD:**- Helps assess progress toward quarterly goals and provides insights into performance trends within the quarter. It can be crucial for quarterly reporting and analysis.

Similarly , by following the above steps

1. Select **Quarter-To-Date** option

2. Drag and drop **Sales** column in base value and **Order Date** in date column( from Orders table)

3. Click on **Add** option

![2](https://github.com/Neha-Chiluka/power-bi-next-level/blob/master/Images/qtd.jpg?raw=true "2")

**Calculating MTD(Month-to-Date) using Quick Measure:**

**TotalMTD:-** Useful for evaluating monthly performance and identifying trends or issues early in the month. It helps in short-term planning and adjustments.

Similarly , by following the above steps

1. Select **Month-to-date** option

2. Drag and drop **sales column** in base value and **Order date ** in date column( from Orders Table)

3. Click on **Add** option

### Finish up

In this task you will complete the lab.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

2. If you intend to start the next lab, leave Power BI Desktop open.
> In the upcoming labs , we will see how can we use these values to help us build meaningful reports. Save the progress, keep PowerBI open to countinue with next lab.
